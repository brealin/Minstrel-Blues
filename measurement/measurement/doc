dependencies
============

build
-----
lua: measurement runtime [+openwrt]
lua-posix: process id [+openwrt]
lua-ex: spawn process [+openwrt]
lua-argparse: command line parser / interface [+openwrt]
lua-rpc: remote procedure calls for lua [+openwrt]
pcap-lua: parse pcap files [-openwrt]

runtime
-------
tcpdump: dump monitor interface packets
iperf (NOT iperf3): generation of payload for measurement
cputime: cpu load
ping: reachablity
ssh/ssh-keygen: start/stop nodes, with authorized keys
kill: stop processes
iw, ifconfig: add monitor
tee: split tcpdump output
ssh-add, ssh-agent: local ssh authorizer for remote command execution (~/.ssh# ssh-add id_rsa)

logging
=======
- single lua rpc node

control
=======
- lua rpc nodes via control network interface
- transfer stats

setup
=====
- add mac addresses of all stations to dhcp (setup should get same ip adresses)
- WAN firewall zone should accept input for ssh connections via WAN
-- ISSUE: when a router is configured as the only dhcp server all clients will not get a ipv4 address from other dhcp server

stations
--------
- no routing at all
- no filtering
- each the wifi and the control interface belongs to different networks
- add route to wifi network on gw

access points
-------------
- no bridged routing between wifi and control interfaces
- each the wifi and the control interface belongs to different networks
- add route to wifi network on gw

utils

cpusage
-------

cpusage is a small program written in C to print the CPU stats periodically. It is bundled within the LEDE old-packages feed.
Since cpusage seems a bit buggy ad we don't need a summary at termination it is wrapped by a simple shell loop that executes
cpusage in single line mode by parameterizing with '-s'. Otherwise cpusages output will disappear from piped stdout. Sometimes
a single line is readable from stdout only and sometimes no output is readable at all. Redirecting the output to a file doesn't
work with lua io.read. Because other programs like 'date' doesn't show this behaviour we choose to limit cpusage to single line output.
